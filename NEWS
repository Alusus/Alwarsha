# Builder 43.alpha0

This release is not intended for end-users.

This is our first release of the GTK 4 port of GNOME Builder. It contains a
significantly redesigned interface and foundry.

Given the size of the Builder project this port is not yet complete. It is
far enough along to get testing from distributions and enthusiastic users
alike. However, expect missing features and please don't overwhelm upstream
with issue reports on that. First check the GTK 4 port issue to see if it
is already known at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder/-/issues/1675

Developer builds of Builder now use org.gnome.Builder.Devel as the application
identifier so that we can allow parallel installing of nightly/stable Flatpaks.

While Builder still supports plugins written in Python, there are no more
Python-based plugins bundled with Builder. We've stopped using the bindings
ourselves due to instability. We may change our scripting language but that
is for another time.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the GTK 4 port, it's been a full out
scramble to port such a gigantic project in one cycle.
